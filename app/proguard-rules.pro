# R8/ProGuard rules for HAM. Minification is currently disabled for release
# builds; these rules exist so that enabling it is safe. Most libraries ship
# consumer rules in their AARs (Ktor, kotlinx-serialization, Tink), so this
# file only pins the reflection surfaces this app relies on directly.

# --- kotlinx.serialization ---
# Generated serializers and companion serializer() lookups for this app's
# @Serializable models (gateway payloads, token store records).
